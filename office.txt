Questions for Dr.J:


asmFile/FILE
synthesize -t -f 200 system

make system.wav:
    runs FILE

asm asmFile/FILE2
make system.wav:
    still runs FILE


dcache:
  Am I setting up the testbench for mapped correctly
  does the code look suspiscious???

.gitignore
  added Makefile to it, was that bad....? (oops)

Is it possible it is a Makefile error..?



What to do from here, please help (very stressed about mapped error)
Frequency has only gone up since pipeline
dual.merge_sort passes on LAT=0 and LAT=2 so clearly working



DR.J

mapped file buffer to ground!!!

Tried Quartus 15
lint
design compiler
not sure

Rohan:
Found that specific signals are lost due to fanout on quartus
	; state~4                                  ; Lost fanout
	; state~5                                  ; Lost fanout
	; state~6                                  ; Lost fanout
	; state~7                                  ; Lost fanout
	; state.RAMWRITE0                          ; Merged with state.CLEANWRITE

./hal.do identified "extraneous logic" but is not verbose enough
gonna attempt to separate next_cache from states and use control signals instead

Dr.J packed

"Certificate"


test.coherence1 (synth)-> 23m :O

testasm -s -d test.coherence1 -> 1m36s

testasm -s -d test.coherence2 -> 45s

testasm -s -d dual.merge -> 3m6s



2:35 pm
FMAX 85c (system.log) -> 31.85 MHz

Gonna attempt to latch signals from Ram to increase CLK speed
